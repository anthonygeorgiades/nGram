The actors were, with one exception, amateurs--coloredworking people who gave their time and services for the sake of whatthey felt to be an artistic expression of the life of their race.The author had no sociological intention; he had no ambition to be apropagandist. He had not even a special interest in the racial problem.He thought that he had come upon an action that has the quality oftragic inevitableness. He thought, furthermore, that tragedy does notreside in pomp and circumstance, but in the profound realities of humanhelpfulness and human suffering, and that poor Lucy Belle struggling tomaintain her spiritual integrity in Goat Alley was a protagonist worthyof the sternest art and the largest sympathy.He built up his action from within. He saw that the Negro cannot yethope, like the white man, to transcend common standards. He must firstreach them. Hence the Negro girl’s struggle for her own integrity isnot yet the struggle of Nora or Magda--the struggle to be true toherself; it is the struggle to remain true to the man of her realchoice. To transcend a necessary order one must first have achievedit. The achievement of social order in the moral sense is thereforethe right and necessary aim of the Negro proletarian and the right andnecessary theme of a drama dealing with his life.In the play, Lucy Belle fights valiantly her losing fight. Loneliness,poverty, ignorance, terror, drive her from disaster to disaster, fromone unwilling infidelity to another. But she never wavers in her soul.In her utter confusion and failure she kills the child that standsbetween her and all her hopes and at once expiates that action withher own death. Neither the subject nor the circumstances are new. Butnovelty is no mark of fine literature. The motives, the people, theplace, the color of life--these are new. Every triangle play is a“Medea”. There are subjects that are classical because they are nativeto the character and circumstances of mankind. Such is the subject of“Goat Alley”. The structure is pure and uncompromising. No Americanplay has had a finer or truer moment than that at the end of the secondact when Lucy Belle, her lodger lost, her money stolen, her childcrying with hunger, consents quietly, yet in such despair, to rent hervacant room to the worthless, ingratiating barber. Hauptmann wouldnot have disdained that quiet moment of rich, tragic implications;Galsworthy would have approved it.No competent observer will fail to note here the evidence of an effortas serious, as intelligent, as sensitive to the character and qualityof what makes tragedy as our recent theatre has produced.      LUDWIG LEWISOHN.New York, July, 1921.GOAT ALLEYCHARACTERS  Lucy Belle Dorsey  Slim Dorsey  Sam Reed  Aunt Rebecca  Lizzie Gibbs  Jeff Bisbee  Chick Avery  Jeremiah Pocher  Fanny Dorsey  } _Children_  Israel Dorsey }  Baby  PolicemanGOAT ALLEY was first publicly presented at the Bijou Theatre, New YorkCity, on the evening of June 20, 1921.ACT I  _The curtain rises on the sitting-room of a Negro’s squalid dwelling     in Goat Alley, Washington, D. C. At Right Back, there is a door     giving directly on the street and when it is open one gets a     glimpse of the miserable, tumble-down houses on the opposite side.     At Left Back is a window, with one pane broken and an old shirt     stuffed in the hole. The one or two old rag-carpet rugs which lie     on the floor serve only in a small measure to cover its bareness.     Several old, broken and battered chairs stand here and there     about the room. At Left Center is a door leading into the other     downstairs room of the house. Between it and the wall, Back, is a     door opening into a closet._  _There is another door, down Right, giving on a flight of stairs     which lead to the one upper room of the house. Near the door, Left     Center, and toward the front stands a battered table on which lie,     in disordered array newspapers and one or two dog-eared books     with their backs off. It is evening and a lighted oil lamp, with     the chimney badly smoked, rests in the center. The wick is turned     low and the guttering flame causes countless shadows to disport     themselves eerily about the room. Between the door, Left Center,     and the door, up Left, stands a fancy cupboard. There is a large     easy chair between the table and the wall, Left Center. Both of     these pieces of furniture look out of place in the room._  _Flamboyant lithographs, a gilt-framed picture of Jack Johnson,     wearing his golden smile, a framed engraving of Abraham Lincoln,     and several grotesque crayon portraits of members of the family     adorn the dirty and discolored walls. An old corset, a half-eaten     roll, and a doll, with its head off, lie about on the floor. A     horseshoe is nailed over the center of the door, Back._  _Aunt Rebecca, an old coal-black Negress, enters, Back. She wears no     hat and has just a shawl thrown over her shoulders. She presents     the appearance of an animated mummy. Her eyes are small and     bead-like and shine with an uncanny lustre; her hands are long     and bony, resembling the talons of a hawk. She glances about     inquiringly, gives an impatient grunt, then turns and slowly     closes the door._AUNT REBECCA (_in high-pitched raspy tones as she moves to the Center_)Lucy Belle! Oh, Lucy Belle!LUCY BELLE (_from the next room_)Dat yo’, Aun’ Becky?AUNT REBECCAYas, honey.LUCY BELLEJes’ a minute. Changin’ mah skirt.(_Aunt Rebecca drops into a chair, Left Center, and begins a weird anddoleful chant._)AUNT REBECCAUm--a--um--a--um--a--um--a--um--a--um--a!

Trouble in mah soul!Um--a--um--a--um--a--um--a--um--a!(_Lucy Belle enters, Left. She is a frail, light brown young Negressof about twenty-eight. She has a nervous, hesitant--and sometimeswistful--manner. She wears a plain black waist and a black skirt,patched in several places._)LUCY BELLE (_feelingly, as she kisses Aunt Rebecca_)Aun’ Becky! I’se so glad ter see yo’ agin! ’Deed I is! (_Draws up achair and sits near her._)AUNT REBECCA (_affectionately_)Po’ful glad ter see yo’, honey!LUCY BELLESeem like ole times--seein’ yo’!

Dat lil’ scrootchin’monkey was’n’ calc’lated ter be de fader ob no boy like Henry.(_Lucy Belle gives an exclamation of surprise. Aunt Rebecca sits inperplexed preoccupation for several moments. At length she speaks veryslowly--dragging out the words, one after another._)AUNT REBECCA’Deed chile, I kain’t seem ter ’member who Henry’s fader was. Dat gingot mah haid so tangle up.LUCY BELLELot done happen since yo’ been ’way.AUNT REBECCADon’ I know it!

(_Threateningly._) Wan’ me ter beat yo’?ISRAELMamma! Git me--(_Lucy Belle grabs them roughly and pushes them through the door, Left,closing it after them. Their cries are heard for several moments andthen gradually cease._)LUCY BELLE (_irritably_)Some day I’se gwine ter git good an’ mad an’ knock dere haids off!AUNT REBECCAHow’s Sam--?LUCY BELLE (_drops down on a chair near Aunt Rebecca and exclaimsecstatically_)Jes’ great!

Aunt Rebeccagets up, grumbling to herself, goes to the door and opens it. LizzieGibbs steps in. She is a large, voluptuous, mulatto woman. She hasstraight hair, high cheek bones, and large coarse features. Her manneris over-bearing and insolent._)LIZZIEH’yo’--?AUNT REBECCA (_surveying her with an air of frank suspicion anddisapproval_)W’at yo’ wan’--?LIZZIE (_swaggering down toward Center with her hands on her hips_)Sam Reed live yere, don’ he--?AUNT REBECCANone ob yo’ bus’ness weder he do or weder he don’--!LIZZIE (_savagely_)Go ’long, yo’ ole black wench!

He is partially bald, but whatremains of his straight, jet-black hair is shiny from the generous useof hair oil, and is carefully brushed to cover the bald spots as muchas possible.

Something abouther manner and the quickness with which she closes the door rouseJeff’s suspicions. He stands--body tense--glaring after her. Absolutesilence ensues. The lock in the door clicks. With a cry of rage Jeffleaps forward and tries to force the door open._)JEFF (_ferociously_)Open de do’! Open it--or I’ll knock yo’ haid off! Open it! (_Mutteringand cursing to himself he puts his shoulder against it and presseshard, but it fails to yield._) Open up!

Realizing, however, that it is perhaps not quite heavyenough for his purpose, he slowly sets it down, stands with his handsresting on its back, and looks about in search of a more formidableweapon. Suddenly shouts, the footsteps of people running, and thenoises of panicky commotion issue from the alley, immediately offstage, Back. It proceeds down the alley, Left, and the noise rapidlylessens in volume, and distinctness. All at once the door, Back, burstsopen and Slim dashes in. He bangs the door shut after him, and standswild-eyed and breathing heavily._)JEFFW’at’s de mattah--?SLIM (_with a gulp--as he recognizes Jeff_)_Po_--_po_-lice!JEFF (_lowering his voice and becoming markedly wary and tense_)_Po_-lice--? Who dey aftah?SLIMRaid Messer’s stable--down de alley yere--(_Someone runs heavily down the alley. Slim springs back and stands ina crouching attitude. Jeff leaps over to the table and blows the lightout._)JEFFCrap game--?SLIMYas.JEFFGit anabody?SLIMDon’ know.(_The noise and clatter recede continually, off Left. At length Slimadvances cautiously to the door, Back, opens it and peers out. Jeffgoes over and stands near him._)SLIMAt de oder end-a de alley, now.JEFFSee yo’ w’en yo’ runs?SLIMSho’--! Slew-foot know me, too. He one-a dem. Liable ter come back disway an’ search ev’y house.(_He opens the door wider and leans far out. A pale light filters infrom Back. The silhouetted figures of the two men can be plainly seen.Jeff joins Slim in the doorway and peers out._)SLIMI’se gwine ter beat it.(_Slim darts off down the alley, Right. Jeff stands tenselydeliberating for several moments. Finally he steps out, and with aswift movement closes the door after him. Almost immediately the door,Left, opens and a broad shaft of light falls across the room from thedoorway, Left, to the wall, Right Back. Lucy Belle enters, followedclosely by Chick. They leave the door open and pause, Right Back, inthe full beat of the light._)CHICK (_as they move to Right, Back_)Oughter shot him in his tracks--!

Good drink set yo’ up jes’ right.(_Lucy Belle takes a faltering step or two toward the door, Left. Justthen someone passes the window, Left Back, and heavy footsteps onthe pavement of the alley can be heard. Lucy Belle halts. She turnsand faces the door, Back. It opens and Sam Reed enters. He is a bigpowerful Negro--dark brown in color--and about thirty-five. He wearsan old, torn suit of clothes, carries an old felt hat, and is withouta collar. His manner is straight-forward, well-meaning, kindly. Hismovements and speech are deliberate--except when he is angry._)SAM (_peering forward through the dim light at them_)Luce--!LUCY BELLE (_with a cry of mingled joy and agitation_)Sam--!SAM (_closing the door and moving slowly down to Center_)H’yo’--?LUCY BELLE (_leaps to his side and grabs his arm_)Sam--Sam-boy!

Sam takes his pipe fromhis coat pocket, fumbles around in the other outside coat pocket, findshis bag of tobacco, pulls it out and begins painstakingly to fill thepipe. Meanwhile he follows Lucy Belle’s movements with an intent,questioning gaze._)LUCY BELLE (_coming back to him_)Honey-baby, been crazy ter see yo’--!SAM (_lays his pipe on the table and takes her in his arms_)Honey-baby!

The door, Back,suddenly bursts open and Jeff Bisbee dashes in. He halts abruptly upondiscovering Sam and stares at him--his face distorted with rage. Sambreaks away from Lucy Belle and starts at him--menacingly._)SAM (_at the top of his voice_)Git out-a yere!(_Lucy Belle gives a cry of anguish and fear and draws back, towardLeft, cowering._)JEFF (_drawing a knife and snapping open the blade_)Who yo’ talkin’ ter?SAMTer yo’!LUCY BELLE (_rushes forward, as though to place herself between them_)Jeff--!

After some desperatemaneuvering, Jeff contrives to swing it down in an attempt to stabSam in the side. Sam diverts the thrust and the blade plunges intoJeff’s side. Jeff gives a groan, his body becomes limp, his kneessag, the muscles of his hand relax and the knife falls to the floor.Sam releases him and he staggers toward the table, Center. He makesa grab for it, misses it, and falls to the floor. He raises himselfon one elbow, puts his free hand to his side, and lies there groaningand rolling his eyes. Sam and Lucy Belle stand gazing down athim--terror-stricken._)LUCY BELLE (_in wild, hysterical tones_)Sam--run! Git out--git out fo’ yo’ life!(_At this juncture a policeman dashes in, Back. He pauses near thedoor for a second, sees Jeff lying on the floor, turns, discovers Sam,springs over and grabs him._)CURTAINACT II  _The same as Act I--one year later. Early afternoon._  _A moment after the rise of the curtain Lucy Belle enters, Left,     carrying her hat and jacket. She advances to Center and lays them     on the table. Her walk is listless and her eyes are bright with     nervous fatigue. She glances at the alarm clock which stands on     top of the cupboard, Left Center. The hands point to half-past     twelve. She drops down in a chair to the left of the table and     stares dismally before her. Presently she rests her elbows on her     knees, bends forward, covers her face with her hands and gives way     to a series of dry, racking sobs._LUCY BELLE (_looking up eventually with a face full of woe_)Sam! Mah ole Sam-boy--come back ter me! Ain’ yo’ evah gwine ter comeback? Honey-baby! Mah own honey-baby, buddy boy!(_From off stage, Right, as though proceeding from the upstairs roomcome the weird, discordant, thin strains of a hymn played on an oldwheezy organ, and an old Negro can be heard singing it in deep,unsteady tones. Lucy Belle becomes momentarily composed and sitslistening as though the music soothed her. In the course of severalmoments she rises, goes to the mirror which hangs on the wall, Right,and stands before it wiping her eyes and adjusting her hair.__Presently the music stops, and someone can be heard coming slowly andheavily down the stairs, Right. Abruptly the door, Right, opens andold man Pocher enters. He is a very old Negro with white hair and aface seamed with wrinkles. His back is quite bent and he walks withthe aid of a heavy, gnarled stick. His manner is a combination of thepatriarchal-Calvinistic, and that of the homely, old, ante-bellum houseservant. He wears an old black suit of clothes, green with age, andcarries an old and very dusty felt hat._)LUCY BELLEH’yo’, Mistah Pocher!POCHERHowdy, chile--howdy!

Lucy Belle stands for a moment, pondering, and a thin smile playsover her face. At length she turns and moves listlessly toward thedoor, Right. As she reaches there, comes the sound of boyish shouts andlaughter and the shuffling of feet about the door, Back. Lucy Bellepauses and listens. She scowls darkly, hurries to the door, and throwsit open. This is followed immediately by the clatter of scurrying feetand taunting shouts as those who were about the door run rapidly downthe alley._)LUCY BELLE (_standing in the doorway and shouting angrily after them_)I seen yo’ Jack Kramer!

Atlength the door, Right, opens and the old man enters carrying a veryold black leather portmanteau--so old and battered and scarred that itlooks as though it were about to fall to pieces. There is fiery resolvein Pocher’s eyes. He gives Lucy Belle a sharp glance and makes directlyfor the door, Back._)LUCY BELLE (_hesitatingly_)H’yo’, Mistah Pocher--!POCHER (_halting and glaring at her_)W’at--?LUCY BELLEYo’--yo’ gwine ’way?POCHERSho’ I’se gwine ’way.LUCY BELLEVisit yo’ son--?POCHER (_fiercely_)I’se gwine ter leave dis place fo’ good.LUCY BELLELeave--fo’ good--!POCHERTol’ yo’ I was’n’ gwine ter put up wid dat nonsense no longer.LUCY BELLEOh, but, Mistah Pocher--POCHERHad er vision dat somebody gwine ter make dem evil sparits riz up on meagin.

He unties the string, fumbles around in the bag,finally pulls out a dirty, torn one-dollar bill._)POCHER (_holding it out to her_)Yere.LUCY BELLE (_advancing and taking it_)T-thanks.

Hereturns the bag to his pocket, picks up his portmanteau and opens thedoor._)LUCY BELLEGoodbye.POCHER (_shortly_)Goodbye. (_He goes out, Back, closing the door after him._)(_Lucy Belle gives a little despairing sigh, then returnsslowly to Center, where she halts and stands staring--somewhatabstractedly--down at the bill in her hand. Slim appears at the window,Left Back, and peers in. At length Lucy Belle goes to the cupboard onthe Left, opens one of the top doors, removes the lid from a crockeryjar, reaches down in it, and takes out her pocket book. She opens thepocket book, extracts three one dollar bills, counts them carefully,places the one she has just received with them and returns them all tothe pocket book. Slim’s face disappears from the window, Left Back.Lucy Belle comes thoughtfully back to Center with the pocket book stillin her hand. At this juncture Israel and Fanny dash in, Back._)ISRAELMamma!

(_They both scamper to thedoor, Back._) Min’ yo’ don’ go out-a dis alley!(_They go out, Back, banging the door shut after them. She drops herpocket book on the table, picks up her coat and puts it on. A lightknock sounds on the door, Back. She starts to answer the door, buthalts abruptly and a look of suspicion comes over her face. Her eyeslight upon the pocket book. She picks it up, goes to the cupboard,Left, drops it in the crockery jar, puts the lid on, closes thecupboard door and hurries to the door, Back. Just as she reaches it,the knock sounds again. She opens it. Chick Avery stands outside._)LUCY BELLEChick--!CHICK (_making an obsequious bow_)Dat’s me!LUCY BELLECome in!(_He enters, carrying a suit case, which he deposits near the door.He looks a little more spruce than in the preceding act and carrieshimself with a decidedly prosperous air.

Chick starts to follow her, whereuponshe runs around to the back of the table, where she stands, breathingheavily and weak from the struggle. Chick stands facing her--on theopposite side of the table and with back to the audience--his musclestaut, as though ready to lunge after her._)LUCY BELLE (_stretching out her arms beseechingly_)Don’, Chick--oh, don’--!

Presently a knock sounds on the door,Back. Chick turns his head and listens. The knock sounds again. Hegoes nonchalantly to the door and opens it. Aunt Rebecca stands in thedoorway._)AUNT REBECCA (_exclaiming_)Gawd-a-massy! Chick Avery, how is yo’?CHICKFine and dandy.(_She steps into the room.

A moment or two later the door, Back,opens a foot or two and Slim sticks his head in and looks about.Seeing no one, he enters stealthily and closes the door slowly andwith extreme care. He moves cautiously to the chair, Left Center, onwhich Lucy Belle’s coat lies. He picks up the coat--or jacket--andgoes rapidly through the pockets in search of her pocket book. Unableto find it in them, he drops the coat and stands in tense thought. Hiseyes wander over to the cupboard, Left. With quick, cat-like movementshe goes to it, opens one of the top doors, removes the lid from acrockery jar, peers into it, sees nothing, removes the lid from thenext one, peers into it, discovers the pocket book, reaches in andtakes it out. He quickly extracts the four one-dollar bills, countsthem and stuffs them in his pocket. He then drops the pocket book backin the jar, replaces the lid, and closes the door of the cupboard. Heslips quickly across to the door, Back, opens it and goes out. In hishurry to get out he gives the door a little bang as he shuts it. Amoment later Lucy Belle enters, Left, with a startled, inquiring lookand glances about._)AUNT REBECCA (_off stage, Left_)W’at’s de mattah?LUCY BELLEThought I yered somebody come in.(_Aunt Rebecca enters, Left._)AUNT REBECCA (_glancing about_)Jes’ now?LUCY BELLEYas.AUNT REBECCAGo ’long!LUCY BELLEReckon I mus’ been dreamin’.AUNT REBECCAW’at yo’ yere?LUCY BELLESoun’ like de do’ shettin’.AUNT REBECCASho’ don’ see nobody.LUCY BELLE (_glancing at the clock on the cupboard.

Lucy Belle puts on her jacket. She goesto the cupboard, Left, opens the top door, removes the lid from thecrockery jar, reaches in and gets her pocket book. Something about itsflatness rouses her curiosity. She casually opens it. A look of tragicdismay comes over her face as she discovers that the money is missing._)LUCY BELLEOh, Gawd!(_She fumbles about in the jar again, then searches through herpockets. It suddenly comes over her that she has been robbed. Shestands staring dumbly before her with an expression of anguish anddespair. Israel and Fanny run in, Back._)ISRAELMamma!

The old woman goesoff hurriedly, Left. Lucy Belle stands hesitant. A look of dire fearcomes over her face, and she appears to be on the verge of collapse.However, with an effort she controls herself and goes uncertainly tothe door, Back, and opens it. Sam steps in. He looks older and thinnerthan in Act I and his hair is streaked with gray, and his shoulders area trifle more stooped than before. He wears a dark suit of clothes--thesort furnished to prisoners on the occasion of their release--a collar,but no tie, and he carries a small bundle under one arm. In one hand hecarries his hat._)SAM (_springing forward with a cry of joy_)Gal--!LUCY BELLE (_rushing to him_)Sam!(_He tosses his hat and the bundle on the table, takes her in his armsand smothers her with kisses._)SAMHoney-baby!

Lucy Belle closes the door, Left.Hurried footsteps are heard off stage, Back. Lizzie glances out of thewindow, Left Back, gives a little gasp, looks wildly about for a placeto hide, runs to the closet door, opens it, darts in and pulls it shutafter her. A policeman enters, Back._)POLICEMAN (_calling out_)What’s the trouble here?(_He stands looking about the room for a moment or two, then advancestoward the door, Left.
